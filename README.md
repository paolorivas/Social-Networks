# Social Networks
### SNA using igraph

In Assignment 3 we will again be looking at some interaction data from students commenting on a class video. The file "comment-data.csv" shows which student responded to which student in an online video platform.

We will be using the "igraph" package to visualize the relationships between students as a network. You can read more about igraph [here](http://igraph.org/r/).
